## Executive Summary

> Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs) are solutions or approaches in hardware or software that help protect a user from privacy violations. The UKâ€™s National 
> Research Centre on Privacy, Harm Reduction, and Adversarial Influence Online (REPHRAIN) is working to conduct research into PETs. This project aims to develop a 
> prototype testbed for REPHRAIN, suitable for use in evaluating the privacy properties of PETs.
> Summary of work:
> - I have developed a flexible command line tool called _kvm-compose_ for Linux using the _Rust_ language and _libvirt_ library, that can build and destroy virtual 
> testbed environments.
> - In the process I have made some contributions to open source libraries including _libvirt-rust_ (the _Rust_ language bindings to _libvirt_).
> - I have then implemented some example projects, which demonstrate how the _kvm-compose_ tool can be used for evaluating PETs.
